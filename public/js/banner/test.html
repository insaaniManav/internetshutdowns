      <h1> Where The Mind is Without Fear</h1>
      <p style="margin-top: 40px; line-height: 30px; font-size: 100%; font-family: serif;">
  Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high <br>
  Where knowledge is free <br>
  Where the world has not been broken up into fragments <br>
  By narrow domestic walls <br>
  Where words come out from the depth of truth <br>
  Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection <br>
  Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way <br>
  Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit <br>
  Where the mind is led forward by thee <br>
  Into ever-widening thought and action <br>
  Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake. <br>
